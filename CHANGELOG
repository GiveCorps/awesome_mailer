0.1.2
  * Added support for @media queries and vendor prefixes
    in the header. Should solve most issues w/CSS3 in
    emails. Obviously it won't fix Outlook. Nothing can fix
    Outlook.

0.1.0
  * Full test coverage and moved to Nokogiri from Hpricot. Also
    added autoload so the gem is there when you need it but won't
    bog down your app startup anymore. Yay!
0.0.3
  * Added Sprockets-based loading for local files. Now your mailers
    work with local assets written with something other than CSS!
0.0.2
  * Fixed a bug left over from when declarations were split into an
    array

0.0.1
  * Hey look, is that ActionMailer::Base? No? Who is that? HOLY CRAP!
		It's AwesomeMailer::Base!
