0.1.0
  * Full test coverage and moved to Nokogiri from Hpricot. Also
    added autoload so the gem is there when you need it but won't
    bog down your app startup anymore. Yay!
0.0.3
  * Added Sprockets-based loading for local files. Now your mailers
    work with local assets written with something other than CSS!
0.0.2
  * Fixed a bug left over from when declarations were split into an
    array

0.0.1
  * Hey look, is that ActionMailer::Base? No? Who is that? HOLY CRAP!
		It's AwesomeMailer::Base!
